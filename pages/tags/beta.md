## Suggested meaning

Designates that an API item's release stage is "beta".  It has been released to third-party developers experimentally
for the purpose of collecting feedback.  The API should not be used in production, because its contract may
change without notice.  The tooling may trim the declaration from a public release, but may include it in a
developer preview release.
